# example-three-tier-application

A reference implementation of a three-tier web application: a Next.js frontend, an Express REST API, and a PostgreSQL database. It runs locally with Docker Compose and deploys to Google Cloud Platform (Cloud Run + Cloud SQL) via Terraform.

## Architecture

```
Browser → Web (Next.js :3000) → API (Express :3001) → PostgreSQL
```

| Layer | Technology | Location |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Frontend | Next.js 16, React 19, Tailwind CSS | `src/web/` |
| API | Express 5, Node.js 22 | `src/api/` |
| Database | PostgreSQL 17 | managed by Docker / Cloud SQL |
| Migrations | node-pg-migrate | `src/db/` |
| Infrastructure | Terraform (GCP) | `src/infrastructure/` |

The app is a simple task manager (to-do list) that demonstrates how the three tiers communicate.

## Running locally with Docker Compose

### Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (or Docker Engine + Compose plugin)

### Start the stack

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This starts four services in order:

1. **postgres** — PostgreSQL 17 database, waits until healthy
2. **migrate** — runs `node-pg-migrate up` to apply schema migrations, then exits
3. **api** — Express API on port 3001 (internal only)
4. **web** — Next.js frontend on port 3000 (exposed to host)

Once running, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Stop and clean up

```bash
# Stop containers (keeps the postgres_data volume)
docker compose down

# Stop and delete all data
docker compose down -v
```

### Rebuild after code changes

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### API endpoints

The API is not exposed directly, but you can reach it through the web container or by temporarily mapping its port:

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/health` | Health check |
| GET | `/tasks` | List all tasks |
| POST | `/tasks` | Create a task (`{ "title": "..." }`) |
| PATCH | `/tasks/:id` | Update a task (`{ "completed": true }` or `{ "title": "..." }`) |

```

## Deploying to GCP

The `src/infrastructure/` directory contains Terraform that provisions:

- VPC network and subnet
- Cloud SQL PostgreSQL 17 instance (private IP)
- Cloud Run services for the API and web frontend
- Secret Manager secret for the database URL
- Service accounts and IAM bindings

### Required variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `project_id` | GCP project ID |
| `api_image` | Container image URI for the API (e.g. `gcr.io/PROJECT/api:TAG`) |
| `web_image` | Container image URI for the web frontend |
| `region` | GCP region (default: `us-central1`) |
| `environment` | `dev`, `staging`, or `prod` (default: `dev`) |

```bash
cd src/infrastructure
terraform init
terraform apply -var="project_id=my-project" \
                -var="api_image=gcr.io/my-project/api:latest" \
                -var="web_image=gcr.io/my-project/web:latest"
```

After apply, `terraform output web_url` gives the public URL.

## Database migrations

Migrations live in `src/db/migrations/` and use [node-pg-migrate](https://salsita.github.io/node-pg-migrate/).

```bash
# Apply all pending migrations (run inside the db container or with DATABASE_URL set)
cd src/db
DATABASE_URL=postgres://app:app@localhost:5432/app npx node-pg-migrate up

# Roll back the last migration
DATABASE_URL=postgres://app:app@localhost:5432/app npx node-pg-migrate down
```

When running via Docker Compose the `migrate` service handles this automatically on startup.

## Code mode

This repository supports AI-assisted development through an orchestrator that can autonomously make code changes and open pull requests. Here's how a code job flows from request to completion:

### Flow overview

```
Frontend UI → Orchestrator API → Sandbox Environment → Git Branch → Pull Request
```

1. **Request submission** — A user submits a coding task through the frontend interface (e.g., "Add a priority field to tasks")

2. **Orchestrator receives job** — The orchestrator API receives the request and provisions an isolated sandbox environment with:
   - A fresh clone of the repository
   - A new working branch (e.g., `forge/code-<uuid>`)
   - Access to development tools (node, npm, git, docker)

3. **Autonomous execution** — Inside the sandbox, an AI agent:
   - Reads relevant source files to understand the codebase
   - Plans the changes across the appropriate tiers (database, API, frontend)
   - Edits files using the complete new contents
   - Runs tests or builds to verify the changes work
   - Commits changes with descriptive messages

4. **Pull request creation** — Once the changes are complete and verified:
   - The working branch is pushed to the remote repository
   - A pull request is opened against the base branch (typically `main`)
   - The PR includes a description of what changed and how it was tested

5. **Human review** — The pull request appears in GitHub for human review, where it can be:
   - Reviewed for correctness and code quality
   - Tested in a preview environment
   - Merged, requested changes, or closed

### Branch naming convention

Code mode branches follow the pattern `forge/code-<uuid>`, which helps identify AI-generated changes and keeps them separate from human-created feature branches.

### Safety and isolation

Each code job runs in an isolated sandbox with:
- No access to production systems or credentials
- A time-limited execution window
- Read-only access to the base branch
- Write access only to its own working branch

This ensures that automated code changes are always subject to human review before reaching production.
